BabelTrace
==========

Trace validation is the process of evaluating a formal specification over a log
of recorded events produced by a system. In addition to the numerous techniques
developed specifically for that purpose over the years, a range of peripheral
tools such as model checkers and database engines can also be used as *bona
fide* trace validators. BabelTrace is an evolvable software environment that
provides a large set of transducers which, when piped into an appropriate chain,
can transform a trace and a formal specification into a suitable input problem
for a variety of available tools.
